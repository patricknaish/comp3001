\section{Prototype Functionality}

The system created was a prototype of a text book selling system for use by university students. The intent is that students, when finishing a module, can put their module text book on the website so that they can sell it to students who will be starting this module after them.

Here is a list of all features implemented in the prototype:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sell books
\item Buy books
\item Search books
\item Basket system
\item PayPal checkout
\item Messaging system
\item Registering users
\item Book templates (for selling books that are already known to the system)
\end{itemize}
